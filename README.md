A recreation of an [earlier Angular project](https://github.com/amychurchwell/taproom) using React. An app for a taproom used to track their kegs.

In your description of the project include your thoughts on the differences in development process in Angular versus React.

## App Objectives

_Patron_
* List/menu of all available kegs.
* Each keg: name, brand, price, and alcoholContent.
* Keg prices are color-coded.
* Alcohol content property is color-coded.

_Employee_

* Form for tapping a new keg to add it to the list.
* Option to edit a keg's properties after entering them.
* Button next to a keg whenever selling a pint. Decreasing number of pints left by 1.
* Kegs with less than 10 pints left are highlighted.

_Both_
* How many pints are left in a keg. Full: 124 pints.

## React Objectives

- [ ] Before coding, spend time planning and drawing out your React app's component structure.

- [ ] No dynamic data. For now, just hard-code data directly into your JSX.

- [ ] Commit history depicts a full day's work.

## Setup Instructions

Clone from GitHub.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/amychurchwell/React-Tap-Room.git
```

Install NPM packages.

## Notes

* Commit notes by themselves.

Unforeseen issues and questions during development.
